A simple information site that contains these sections: Home, About, Leadership, Contact, and Blog.
Header and footer with navigation. 
Logo in the upper left hand corner. 
The website, with the exception of blog, should present all sections on the main site landing page: Home, About, Leadership, Contact. 
Blog should be accessible from the header navigation, and footer. 
And the user experience should be smooth â€“ when the user clicks on the section of interest (ie About) the page should scroll to that section of the home page. In other words: the sections should all be on the same page. 
Contact section should have contact form.
