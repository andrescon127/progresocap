Logo in the upper left hand corner. 
The website, with the exception of blog, should present all sections on the main site landing page: Home, About, Leadership, Contact. 
Blog should be accessible from the header navigation, and footer. 
And the user experience should be smooth â€“ when the user clicks on the section of interest (ie About) the page should scroll to that section of the home page. In other words: the sections should all be on the same page.
