            <h2>Leadership</h2>
            <div class="leader-profile">
                <h3>Andrew Contreras, Founder</h3>
                <div class="leader-bio">
                    <p>Having grown up in Oklahoma, the oil and gas business was a natural career path for Andrew – interested in math, science, and money. After studying mechanical engineering at Oklahoma State University, he ventured into the world of drilling rigs, roughnecks, and $100 barrel of oil. Engineering gave him a deep understanding of systems, processes, and structured problem-solving—skills that would later play a crucial role in his success in marketing.</p>
                    <p>But something was missing. While the work was financially rewarding, it lacked creativity, and he felt unfulfilled.</p>
                    <p>Years later, Andrew stumbled upon copywriting and digital marketing. And everything changed...</p>
                    <p>He became obsessed with the process of turning a blank sheet of paper into a compelling offer, persuading total strangers to buy products, and doing all of this from anywhere in the world. Using words to "print money" (from a laptop in Colombia) was like a drug. And he was an addict...</p>
                    <p>So, Andrew poured himself into mastering copywriting and digital marketing, which helped generate over $250 million in profitable revenue during the last 8 years. But then, he became a "victim" of his own success. No one ever told him that selling millions of dollars' worth of products online would mean having to actually build a business capable of handling those sales.</p>
                    <p>He felt like an oil man all over again... but this time he was drilling wells with no pipelines to move that oil and get it to market.</p>
                    <p>Suddenly, copywriting wasn't enough. If Andrew wanted to keep growing the business, he had to become great at hiring, leadership, and management. Fortunately, he had his engineering background to lean on.... He approached scaling a company the same way he once approached complex engineering problems: designing systems, optimizing processes, and structuring teams to perform at a high level.</p>
                    <p>That mindset was key in helping Red Hot evolve from a scrappy marketing venture into a high-performing direct-to-consumer powerhouse. Under Andrew's leadership, they built a global team of 50+ people, scaled multiple brands to 8-figure revenues, and created systems and processes that made growth sustainable. And in 2024, Red Hot was acquired.</p>
                    <p>Today, Andrew focuses on investing, advising, and exploring new creative ventures through Progreso Capital.</p>
